I have created API for Login ,Register, OTP Verification, using mongodB Working of API is define below:

1. After cloning the code from git. give command npm install.
2. after that give command npm start to run the server.
3. server will start running on port 1000


Before moving to post name I request you to create a db on mongodb and take out the password to put it in the env file db connection link at password place. so that you DB get connected.


Signup: 

Move to postman and give the request in this format:
{
        "firstname": "Akash",
        "lastname": "Sharma",
        "email": "akash@gmail.com",
        "password": "123456"  
}
use URL: localhost:1000/signup with   (POST Method)







then for OTP verification use this request:
{
    "otp":926642
}
use URL: localhost:1000/verify with   (POST Method)




Then for Login :
{
    "email":"akash@gmail.com",
    "password":"123456"
}
use URL: localhost:1000/login with (GET Method)
